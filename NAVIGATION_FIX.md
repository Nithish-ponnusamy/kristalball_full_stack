# Navigation Buttons Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Fixed
The "View All" and "Manage Stock" buttons in the Dashboard were not working because they lacked onClick handlers and navigation functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. App.js Changes
- ✅ **Added `onNavigate` prop** to all component calls
- ✅ **Passed `setCurrentPage` function** to enable navigation from child components

### 2. Dashboard.js Changes  
- ✅ **Added `onNavigate` prop** to component signature
- ✅ **"View All" button** now navigates to Transfers page with toast notification
- ✅ **"Manage Stock" button** now navigates to Purchases page with toast notification
- ✅ **Added visual feedback** with success toast messages

### 3. Component Consistency
- ✅ **Updated all components** (Purchases, Transfers, AssignmentsExpenditures) to accept `onNavigate` prop
- ✅ **Maintained consistency** across the application architecture

## Button Functionality

### "View All" Button (Recent Transfers section)
```javascript
onClick={() => {
  if (onNavigate) {
    onNavigate('transfers');
    toast.success('Navigating to Transfers page...');
  }
}}
```
- **Action**: Navigates to Transfers page
- **Feedback**: Shows success toast notification
- **Animation**: Maintains hover and tap animations

### "Manage Stock" Button (Low Stock Alerts section)  
```javascript
onClick={() => {
  if (onNavigate) {
    onNavigate('purchases');
    toast.success('Navigating to Purchases page...');
  }
}}
```
- **Action**: Navigates to Purchases page  
- **Feedback**: Shows success toast notification
- **Animation**: Maintains hover and tap animations

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Immediate feedback** with toast notifications
2. **Smooth navigation** between pages
3. **Consistent behavior** across all navigation elements
4. **Maintained animations** for professional feel

## Testing
- ✅ **No compilation errors**
- ✅ **All components updated** 
- ✅ **Navigation system working**
- ✅ **Toast notifications functioning**

The buttons now work as expected and provide clear navigation paths for users to manage transfers and stock from the dashboard.
